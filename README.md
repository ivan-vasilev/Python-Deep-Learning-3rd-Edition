This is the code repository for [Python Deep Learning - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-deep-learning-third-edition/9781837638505), published by Packt.

**Understand how deep neural networks work and apply them to real-world tasks**

## What is this book about?

The field of deep learning has developed rapidly in the past years and today covers broad range of applications. This makes it challenging to navigate and hard to understand without solid foundations. This book will guide you from the basics of neural networks to the state-of-the-art large language models in use today.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Establish theoretical foundations of deep neural networks
* Understand convolutional networks and apply them in computer vision applications
* Become well versed with natural language processing and recurrent networks
* Explore the attention mechanism and transformers
* Apply transformers and large language models for natural language and computer vision
* Implement coding examples with PyTorch, Keras, and Hugging Face Transformers
* Use MLOps to develop and deploy neural network models

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
def build_fe_model():

    """"Create feature extraction model from the pre-trained model ResNet50V2"""

    # create the pre-trained part of the network, excluding FC layers
    base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV3Small
```
